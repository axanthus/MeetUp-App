MeetUp is a time/schedule-sharing web app that allows for groups of people to view their availability and decide when to meet. Users can create a meeting, set the range of dates, and send invites to collaborators via email. Collaborators can then select on a grid the days and hours they're available. This application is currently in the development phase. 

Originally a class project, this application was built with an underlying cloud infrasturcture that could be deployed to the public cloud, consisting of a containerized server and DB in addition to a VM.

### Basic Instructions:

Start with the host_main.sh file and then go from there

The code would basically be set up as

- Setting up VM and creating the environment for application

- Creating the docker containers

- deploying the application

Read the report for more information on how to set it up
